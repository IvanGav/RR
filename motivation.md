# Why use RR at all?
### What is it made for? Why is it useful?

Short answer - it's not.

Long answer - it's meant to replace R completely and utterly.

What is R useful for?
- Doing graphs
- Writing papers with graphs included
- Stats
- Data science?
- Discrete math?

What should I do to replace R?
- Not focus on making RR general purpose - it should do exactly what it's meant to - everything that R can, but not much more (and better)
- Not focus on optimizing quite yet - it's an afterthought. It should be nice to use, intuitive, *best possible* docs and pretty output.
- Copying data behind variables is ok. I can think about it later.
- Hard coded and non-expandable functionality is ok (for the time being). It can always be changed with relative ease.
- Don't hard focus on graphs and data science just yet - it will be expanded when the time is right.

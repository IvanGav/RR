l = ["Logsday", "lll", 6]

// second item should be "log"

l[1] = "log"

print(concat(l, " ") + "!!")

// also `=(var, 2)` doesn't work anymore :)

// btw, adding indexing into arrays was just a few minutes AFTER i spent a few hours refactoring how i call functions...
// it's still horrible, i'll need to spend another 5 hours fixing what i did in the past 3 hours
// oh and mem leaks are real -_-

// but hey i also have automated testing now!

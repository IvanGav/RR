log5 = "Logsday log 5"

// i didn't do much this week
// i had a break week, so to say
// also due to how i parse files, i can do this; log5 = log5 + "!"
// that's because you can normally use semicolon instead of newline
// though i can easily make it so that semicolon is not treated as a newline inside of comments
// anyway, wait for more updates next logsday!
